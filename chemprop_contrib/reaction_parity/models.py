class ParityEquivariantMPNN(MPNN):
    r"""An :class:`~chemprop.models.MPNN` that is exactly parity-equivariant under reversal.

    With ``g`` the full stack (message passing, aggregation, batch norm, predictor) and
    :math:`\bar{x}` the reversed reaction, each output head is predicted as

    - odd:  :math:`\tfrac12[g(x) - g(\bar{x})]`, so :math:`f(\bar{x}) = -f(x)`
    - even: :math:`\tfrac12[g(x) + g(\bar{x})]`, so :math:`f(\bar{x}) = f(x)`
    - free: :math:`g(x)`, unconstrained

    A pair of columns (``paired_difference`` or ``paired_reverse``) is predicted from an even
    head and an odd head, and its loss also scores the pair's implied third member. Which
    columns are which is declared by ``target_transform``, which also scales the targets.

    Both passes share every weight, and are stacked on the batch dimension before batch norm
    so that in train mode they see identical batch statistics. The guarantee is exact in
    ``eval()``; in train mode, independent dropout masks make it approximate.

    Inputs must be featurized with :class:`ParityCGRFeaturizer`; prefer
    :meth:`from_featurizer`, which reads ``odd_atom_start`` and ``odd_bond_start`` from it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    message_passing, agg, batch_norm, **kwargs
        as for :class:`~chemprop.models.MPNN`
    predictor : Predictor
        ``RegressionFFN``, ``MveFFN``, ``EvidentialFFN`` or ``QuantileFFN``, without an
        ``output_transform`` (the target transform does the unscaling)
    odd_atom_start : int
        first node-feature column of the odd (``d``) block
    odd_bond_start : int
        first edge-feature column of the odd (``d``) block
    target_transform : ParityTargetTransform
        the parity of each target column and the target scaling; the model keeps a copy

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        if ``target_transform`` is not a :class:`ParityTargetTransform`.
    ValueError
        if the predictor is not one of the supported regression predictors, has an
        ``output_transform``, or has a different number of tasks than ``target_transform``;
        or if ``target_transform`` has paired columns and the predictor is not a plain
        ``RegressionFFN``.

    Notes
    -----
    Inputs must come from :class:`ParityCGRFeaturizer`. Chemprop's own CGR featurizer is not in
    the ``(s, d)`` basis; :meth:`from_featurizer` rejects it, but the plain constructor only
    sees dimensions and offsets and cannot tell.

    Extra descriptors ``X_d`` and extra atom descriptors ``V_d`` are passed identically to the
    forward and reversed graphs, so they must be direction-invariant.

    Atom/bond feature scaling (``message_passing.graph_transform``) is allowed: it is applied
    inside the encoder, after the reversal, so it is part of ``g`` and the combination
    stays exact.

    :meth:`fingerprint` returns the forward-direction fingerprint only, so its shape is
    unchanged but it is direction-dependent; the parity structure lives in the combination of
    predictor outputs.
